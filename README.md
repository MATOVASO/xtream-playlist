<summary>About M3U Playlists</summary>
M3U (Moving Picture Experts Group Audio Layer 3 Uniform Resource Locator) is a file format originally designed for audio playlists that has evolved to become widely used for video streaming, particularly in IPTV services. 

M3U files are simple text documents containing URLs to media resources, allowing various players to access streaming content from different sources. M3U8 is the UTF-8 encoded version of this format, offering enhanced support for international characters and additional features required by HTTP Live Streaming (HLS).
